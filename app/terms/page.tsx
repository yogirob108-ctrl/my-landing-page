For groups of 3–8, submitting the form creates a group request first: Rob confirms the date, horse, guide, and host-family capacity before sending the correct Stripe payment link or custom order. Your spot is not guaranteed until the required online payment has been received and confirmed by us. The remaining local family payment is paid directly in clean USD cash to the nomadic host families in Mongolia and is not collected online by 8 Lakes Tours.',

Group prices are confirmed personally by Rob before payment. Each price includes a $999 USD online booking payment through 8 Lakes Tours and a local family cash payment made directly to the nomadic host families in Mongolia. The tour price includes all accommodation, meals, horses and guiding as described on our website. Flights, travel insurance, visas, and personal expenses are not included.',

If you cancel within 3 weeks / 21 days of departure, we will still try to help with a transfer to another available date, an approved replacement traveller, or a partial refund where host, horse, transport, guide, or group logistics costs have not already been committed. If 8 Lakes Tours cancels your departure, the online amount paid to us will be refunded minus unrecoverable Stripe/payment processing fees. The local family payment is paid in cash in Mongolia and is not collected online by 8 Lakes Tours before departure.
